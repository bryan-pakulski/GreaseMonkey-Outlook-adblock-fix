## Sick of this?
The outlook AD panel detects the usage of an adblocker & takes up valuable screen real-estate, this script removes the advertisements panel all together & recovers that space.

### NOTE:
This also works as an ad blocker so it will also remove the advertisements if you aren't running ublock or other adblockers.
